# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
*This further solidified my decision to join Turing!! Was awesome and looking forward to the rest of the Mods and beyond.*
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
*Workflow is good.*
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
*Guessing this is for the evenings sessions? I say, "Bring it on!!"*
